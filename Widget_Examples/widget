from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget # type: ignore

#Only need  for access to command line arguments
import sys

#You only need one QApplication instance
#Pass in sys.argv to allow us to do command line arguments
#If you do not use command line args "QApplication([])"
app = QApplication(sys.argv)

#Create a Qt widget, which will be our window
window = QWidget()
#important!! Windows are hidden by default
window.show()

#Start the event loop
app.exec()

#Your Application wont reach here until you exit 
#and the event loop has stopped
